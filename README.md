This analytics project is an attempt to extract notable valued cryptocurrencies from all existing coins only with the help of past market data and public opinion data(data from social media). It can also be defined as creating an algorithm to rank coins from most valued to the opposite.We have also calculated how much our ranking algorithm is similar with coingecko_score/rank.
Data_collect_API.ipynb is the code by which we used to collect data from coingecko API. we preprocessed the data using python and have stored it in two files named cmd_final.xlsx and pod_final.xlsx. crypto_extraction is the file where you could find the whole process ranking. 
We have used an hypothesis testing at the begining to make sure of the trend between the coins. And then we used multiple clustering algorithm and inner merging the results to get the best out of all.
