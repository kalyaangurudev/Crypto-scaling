This analytics project is an attempt to extract notable valued cryptocurrencies from all existing coins only with the help of past market data and public opinion data(data from social media). It can also be defined as creating an algorithm to rank coins from most valued to the opposite.We have also calculated how much our ranking algorithm is similar with coingecko_score/rank.
